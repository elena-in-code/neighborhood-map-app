* For the locations info: [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Query#Generators)

### The application usage:
* It is a application that displays a map with 5 locations in Madrid, Spain.
* This locations are museums located in the capital.
* You can get information for each location by clicking on the marker located in the map, clicking over the list on the aside section, or by filtering using the selector.
* Selecting a location will make the marker of that location animate so you can easily know where it is located.
